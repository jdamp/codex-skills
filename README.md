# codex-skills

This repository contains my personal Codex skill collection.

Current skills in this repo include:
- `git-worktree-manager`
- `github-issue-creator`

## Install skills from this repo

From Codex, ask it to run `skill-installer` for this repo. Example prompt:

```text
$skill-installer Install these skills from GitHub repo `jdamp/codex-skills`:
- `skills/git-worktree-manager`
- `skills/github-issue-creator`
```

Restart Codex after installation so the new skills are loaded.
